If we were to change this feature to a positive value, it could potentially reverse the prediction. Specifically, if we were to change \"Capital Gain\" to a value of 56, the prediction would likely be negative.\n\nTherefore, the minimum change required to potentially reverse the prediction is to change the \"Capital Gain\" feature to a positive value of 56.",
